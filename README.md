# Delhivery_Feature-Engineering: Understanding Trip & Segment Attributes

🚀 Project Overview

Delhivery, India's largest logistics and supply chain company, leverages cutting-edge technology to optimize its operations. This project focuses on analyzing trip and segment data to gain insights into:

✅ Actual vs. OSRM values of trip attributes
✅ Date-time variations affecting deliveries
✅ Location-based trends in logistics efficiency


🎯 Objective
Analyze Delhivery’s trip and segment data for insights into logistics efficiency.
Compare Actual vs. OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine) values for delivery time and distance.
Identify patterns in location-based and time-based variations.
Provide data-driven recommendations for route optimization & performance improvement.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

Programming: Python 🐍
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Data Analysis & Visualization: EDA, statistical insights

📂 Dataset

Trip Attributes: Distance, duration, route efficiency
OSRM Values: Estimated time & distance vs. actual trip data
Date-time Factors: Peak vs. off-peak hours, seasonal variations
Location Details: City-wise and region-wise trends

🔍 Approach

1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handle missing values, filter inconsistencies.
2️⃣ EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): Identify patterns in delivery times, distances, and OSRM variations.
3️⃣ OSRM vs. Actual Analysis: Compare estimated vs. real-world trip attributes.
4️⃣ Insights & Optimization Recommendations: Suggest improvements for route planning & operational efficiency.

📈 Expected Outcomes

🔹 Identify key gaps between estimated and actual trip performance.
🔹 Discover patterns in delivery efficiency based on time and location.
🔹 Provide actionable insights for optimizing logistics and improving delivery times.
